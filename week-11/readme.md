# Week 11, let's get a move on here...

Bad Coding Joke of the week... The computer is mightier than the pen, the sword, and usually, the programmer.

Todays class was a bit of a shorter one for me as we started the morning with some catchups with Andy and Karen, I had my first meeting with Andy and after a bit of a discussion we realised that the project I had in mind was a bit out of my reach and skills. So we decided to strip it back and focus on just one aspect of the idea and focus on creating an actual working sketch. I was actually really excited by this as it gave me a clear direction to head in and this project became a little less overwhelming. After this catch up I spent the rest of the day exploring my new ideas. I really wanted to focus of using the type from the chosen text to convey the feelings of uncertainty in the future of generative design and graphic design. Fingers Crossed I can get something working in time for next weeks showcase.
