# Week 10... Does anyone have a map?

Bad Coding Joke of the week... Debugging: Removing the needles from the haystack.

Week 10 is upon us and this week we had a milestone review, I'm not going to lie I'm quite lost at the moment of the direction of my project or if I even have the skills or passion for code to really seek them, however after seeing everyone elses amazing work, I knew it was time to get a move on and start forming some concrete ideas and pieces of work. I'm honestly find the coding language very difficult to navigate and understand, it's nothing like i've ever done before, but It really intrigues me to maybe explore away from class after the semester is over the possibilities of code in my own time at my own pace. My feed back from my milestone was that I still had a lot of work to do as my sketch wasn't even functioning yet.
