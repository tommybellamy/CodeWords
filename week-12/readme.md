# Final Week... Showtime

Bad code Joke of the week... All programmers are playwrights, and all computers are lousy actors.

This was the week, the week we had all been waiting for. 12 weeks of hard work and learning a new language most of us had never learnt before, But before we showcased our work we got a live demonstration from andy on how to make our own GIFs in photoshop. I actually really enjoyed this as it is something I've already used in my work away from uni. We also had to fill out all of our information about our projects, I found this a really nice time to reflect on the project and the time spent on it during the semester. Although my project wasn't the flashiest by anymeans I'm glad I was able to produce a working sketch after basically starting again from the week before, If I had stumbled onto this idea earlier in the semester who knows what else I could've added to it, but in the end I'm happy I could produce something.
