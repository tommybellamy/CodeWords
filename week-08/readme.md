# Paper Prototypes and Live Coding

Bad code Joke of the week... Eight bytes walk into a bar.  The bartender asks, “Can I get you anything?”
“Yeah,” reply the bytes.  “Make us a double.”



This week was a very important week, It was my first time seeing everyones paper prototypes. I was extremely impressed with everyones creativity and unique ways of interpritting their chosen readings, unfortunately this week has shown me I am quite behind the 8 ball, however it was really motivating to see how far everyone was willing to push their ideas for their code. I acknowledge that I might of been a little too reserved with what I tried to achieve with my paper prototype to suit what I actually believed would be possible to create. Even though I find it really challenging to show my work to my peers, especially when it's not quite up to standard however I am glad I did because it gave me the feedback I needed. I want to now try and push the idea of generative design in my piece of code, considering my reading is from "Generative design: Redefining the designer" by Yolanda Zappaterra, I find it really interesting how the role of the designer is explored and how it is always changing and evolving and how designers must learn to adapt.

My chosen paragraph from the piece is "With generative design, the performance criteria are embedded in the process itself, which produces a wide population of informed possible solutions. A shift from building to growing, sculpting to breeding. In this sense, generative designers become closer to scientists on the one hand, gardeners on the other." Andy and Karen Ann talked about expanding more of the key words building, growing, sculpting, breeding, scientists, gardeners. How I'll do this, isnt quite clear to me yet however I'll spend the next week experimenting with ideas. 

After the break we started some live coding which is something I actually quite enjoy. Todays session was really interesting as we experimented with the techniques of using Letters, words and sentences in our code. Unfortunately I had to leave class early due to a car emergency, However I will follow up on the rest of the coding over the next week.
