# Week 4 How about some Code.

Today we spent the day doing some coding, which was really good as I really wanted to delve a bit deeper a learn a little more of what it means to code. In the first half of the class we were introduced to adding fonts into the processing file, and how to actually set the code up so that the program knows to use the specific code. I found it interesting how you had to actually add it into the programming document for the program to be able to access. 

For the rest of the week I worked with my other group members for our first brief, this ended up being so much harder then we expected because we were not able to join each other in a single world, even though we were able to do this the week before. However dueto having a really commited group we were able to finish the whole project within 24 hours!!! we congrats to my fellow group members it was pretty painful. Also a shout out to andy who took the time out of his busy schedule to try and help us with our server issues.
