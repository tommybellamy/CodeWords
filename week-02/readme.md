# Week #2: Modular Typefaces and intro mysterious GitHub.

Unfortunately During week 2 I was experience one of my classic internet breakdowns where my internet decides to throw a tantrum and not work for the day, I guess you take the good and the bad living in regional Aus, Internet Is definitely one of the bad ones. However what I was able to gather was some information on Modular Typefaces, as we explored past pieces from other designers for our final projects. Upon doing my own research I stumbled upon a trio of artists who work with modular typeface, Minna Sakaria, Carolina Dahl and Maria Ines Gul. I found it really interesting as this isn't something I have studied much in the past.

In the second half of our lesson we studied this very interesting place called github, to this day I still find it quite hard to use and navigate but I'm working on it. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do much more in this class because my internet, totally shut down for a mid day snoooooze. zzzz

So it's a short one this week xx
