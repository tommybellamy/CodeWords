# Week 3 Electronic Literature and Minecraft. 

This week we explored electric literture, with what it is and what it is trying to offer. It's basically normal literature, but cyber, I guess, I'm not really sure I'm not very techy like that. In todays class I got introduced to words I've never heard of like chatbots and a thing called Eviebot which responds to you using only phrases that other people have typed into the program. This is kinda wack to me, not sure if I'm too old for this modern generation already at 21 or if I just have to "get with the times." 

We also played as a class a generative text game called AI dungeon which developes its only story line depending on what you type into the chat, doing this as a class was really fun as some of my fellow classmates were typeing things, I would of never thought of. Like one student deciding to kill god, then become god, then kill god in a crazy loop. I'm honestly in constant awe of the students around me as their creativity and uniqueness inspire me as a designer. 

For the rest of the day we got to split up and work in our own seperate groups for the first brief, I was working in one of the minecraft groups with Amy and Ziyun, best group members to work with, they were super chilled and supportive as we bounced ideas off each other. Was very Wholesome. We mainly focussed on exploring the idea of making the house bigger on the inside then it appeared on the outside.
