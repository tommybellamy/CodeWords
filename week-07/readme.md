# Week 7 Java Script and Sound? Tell me more.

Bad code Joke of the week... “I just saw my life flash before my eyes and all I could see was a close tag…”

This week we shared which extract we had chosen from our bodies of text as well as a first look at our paper prototypes in small groups. I found this really interesting to see what a couple of my fellow students were working on and their unique ideas on how they would transfer these bodys of text to code. It is interesting to see the difference in students how some work in a more literal sense while others work in a really abstract and unique way. I'm more wired to work in a literal way so I find the abstract piece of work especially interesting.

After lunch, you guessed it... we worked on anotherlive coding session with Karen Ann through which she demonstrated extending Javascript's p5.js with other libraries. We then worked with developing a java script that imports and analyses sounds file by using the core p5.sound library. I was really interested in this live coding session because I think will be very important for my project.
