# Week 09, time for a recharge.

Unfortunately the stress of everything became a bit too much this week and I wasn't able to attend class this week, I still managed to get some coding done throughout the week however it still wasn't nearly enough to get my project on track and at an acceptable level. Hopefully a bit of a recharge will allow me to produce some better work over the coming weeks.
