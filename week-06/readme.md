# Week 6 Paper Prototypes, work of a uni student or grade 2 student?

Bad code Joke of the week... All programmers are playwrights, and all computers are lousy actors. 

We started this close by noting the piece of critical theory that we would be working with for our final project, I found it really interesting the wide variety of texts chosen by the class with only a few of the texts having double ups. After reading a few of the texts I thought I'd go with "Generative design: Redefining the designer" by Yolanda Zappaterra mostly because I found it quite interesting and I think it was one of the easier texts to comprehend, as I am not a very strong reader. I find it really interesting how the role of the designer is explored and how it is always changing and evolving and how designers must learn to adapt. My chosen part of the text is "With generative design, the performance criteria are embedded in the process itself, which produces a wide population of informed possible solutions. A shift from building to growing, sculpting to breeding. In this sense, generative designers become closer to scientists on the one hand, gardeners on the other." because it paints a very clear picture to me on what it is trying to explain and I think this can lead to me producing a strong and clear piece of code.

We then practiced making our own prototypes in small groups. Initially this felt like a primary school project however I quickly realised there was much more to it. It allowed for quick rough ideas to be experimented with. My group and I worked on creating the video game Space Invaders which was not as hard as I initially thought it would be and it was actually quite fun. It was also nice spending time with my other group members on how iso life is treating them.
